      <br>-OHMS</h2>
    <p>OHMS (Our High resistance Maintained in all types of Shapes)

         There were a group of boys who were treated like slaves. These boys were so frustrated and stressed so they had no choice but to spit out words that were really ungreatful for a being to hear and tell backstories when they are piled.

          These boys were observing the other behaviors of the criminal and saw that they were not the only one who was treated unequally but also the girls that they know were done.

           One day, one of the boys said something and really made the other boys realize and that was the thought of him making a hidden organization that would avenge those abused kinds not physically but in other ways.

           The boys were having their electronics class and the lesson was all about resistance in which they knew who George Simon Ohms back then and what he had fought for his life. The discoverer had struggles in his life relating asto what the boys were feeling. One of the boys spoke and said "why don't we name our group ohms? " all boys glanced to him and cheered quietly "ohms is the symbol for resistance and resistance is what we need for this group" he said. Everyone agreed with him and started a new chapter.

             Then the boys named the group Ohms and wrote rules and guides. They recruited new members for larger voices and soon in the future their work may lead to something great.</p>
